### Survey_Dataset_Exploration.ipynb

This notebook serves as the starting point for our analysis. It explores the survey dataset in detail, performing the following tasks:

- Displaying the first 5 rows of the dataset to understand its structure.
- Determining the number of rows and columns in the dataset.
- Examining the data types of each column to ensure consistency.
- Calculating the mean age of survey participants to understand the age distribution.
- Identifying the number of unique countries represented in the dataset to gauge geographical diversity.

### Data_Wrangling.ipynb

In this notebook, we clean and prepare the dataset for analysis. The data wrangling process involves:

- Identifying and removing duplicate entries to ensure data integrity.
- Handling missing values through imputation techniques to prevent bias in analysis.
- Normalizing the data to bring consistency and standardization, if necessary.

### Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb

The exploratory data analysis (EDA) notebook dives deep into understanding the dataset's characteristics. It includes:

- Exploring the distribution of data across different variables to identify patterns.
- Identifying outliers that may skew the analysis and deciding how to handle them.
- Removing outliers, if necessary, to ensure accurate analysis.
- Examining correlations between variables to understand relationships and potential dependencies.

### Data_Visualization.ipynb

This notebook focuses on visualizing the dataset to extract meaningful insights. It includes:

- Connecting to a database, if applicable, to access additional data sources.
- Creating visualizations such as histograms, box plots, scatter plots, bubble plots, pie charts, stacked charts, line charts, and bar charts.
- Visualizing the distribution of data, relationships between variables, composition of data, and comparisons across different categories.
- Closing the database connection after visualization to ensure data security.

### Tech Trend Analysis.pdf

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the analysis conducted in the previous notebooks. It includes:

- An executive summary summarizing the key findings and implications.
- Discussion of technology trends observed in the data, including JavaScript dominance, PostgreSQL emergence, and demographic insights.
- Methodology overview detailing the approach used for data analysis.
- Results section with visualizations, charts, and a dashboard for easy interpretation.
- Discussion of findings and implications for strategic decision-making.
- Conclusion highlighting the importance of adapting to emerging technologies and addressing demographic challenges.
- Appendix containing additional details, if needed.

## Summary

This analysis provides valuable insights into current technology trends and their potential impact on various industries, aiding in informed decision-making processes.
